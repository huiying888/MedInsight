**MedInsight** is an AI-powered medical document query tool that lets healthcare teams ask natural-language questions and instantly find answers inside large collections of PDFs—guidelines, reports, and scanned documents.  
The goal is to provide clinicians and administrators with actionable insights from medical documents, enabling them to access critical information without manually searching through countless files.  
It combines **smart PDF search with OCR**, **structure-aware understanding of tables and sections**, and an **interactive AI assistant** that delivers concise answers with source citations, helping healthcare teams make faster and more confident decisions at the point of care.

## Problem Statement: AI-Powered Medical Document Query Tool
Healthcare professionals in Malaysia face the challenge of:  
- Critical patient data and clinical guidelines buried in unstructured PDFs.  
- Manual searches that are time-consuming and error-prone.  
- Difficulty extracting accurate insights from scanned, legacy, or complex medical documents.

---

## Solution

MedInsight solves this by:

- Providing a seamless plug-in layer that integrates with existing hospital HIS/EMR systems without requiring replacement.  
- **Smart PDF extraction** using OCR + NLP to handle both scanned and digital PDFs, extracting tables, charts, and free text into queryable data.  
- **Upload PDFs** directly via the interface: files are automatically saved to the cloud (AWS S3) and trigger OCR and embedding generation for meaningful, semantic queries.  
- **Natural language, chat-style query interface** allowing doctors to ask questions in plain English or Malay (e.g., “Show me Mr. Ali’s last 3 HbA1c results.”).  
- **Contextual answering** that highlights relevant PDF sections, reducing scrolling and manual searching.  
- Transforming unstructured medical documents into an accessible knowledge base for faster, more confident clinical decisions.

## Reflection

**Challenges:**
- Processing multi-source PDFs, including scanned docs, with OCR and PyMuPDF.  
- Implementing AI search with AWS Bedrock (Nova Pro, Titan) and FAISS for fast, accurate retrieval.  
- Deploying frontend (React) and backend (Flask) on AWS EC2 with PM2/Waitress and managing real-time query handling.  

**Learnings:**
- AWS Bedrock simplifies LLM integration for natural-language querying.  
- Combining structured dashboards with AI Q&A enhances flexibility and usability.  
- Using AWS S3 with FAISS enables scalable storage and semantic search for large document collections.  
- Chat-like interface with source citations improves trust and decision-making efficiency.
