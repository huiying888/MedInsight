Infectious noninflammatory \ndiarrhea is often viral in etiology and is the most common presentation;\u200b however, bacterial causes are also common and may be \nrelated to travel or foodborne illness.

Most \nepisodes of acute diarrhea in countries with adequate food and water sanitation are uncomplicated and self-limited, requiring \nonly an initial evaluation and supportive treatment. Additional diagnostic evaluation and management may be warranted when \ndiarrhea is bloody or mucoid or when risk factors are present, including immunocompromise or recent hospitalization. Unless \nan outbreak is suspected, molecular studies are preferred over traditional stool cultures. In all cases, management begins \nwith replacing water, electrolytes, and nutrients. Oral rehydration is preferred;\u200b however, signs of severe dehydration or sepsis \nwarrant intravenous rehydration. Antidiarrheal agents can be symptomatic therapy for acute watery diarrhea and can help \ndecrease inappropriate antibiotic use. Empiric antibiotics are rarely warranted, except in sepsis and some cases of travelers\u2019 \nor inflammatory diarrhea. Targeted antibiotic therapy may be appropriate following microbiologic stool assessment. Hand \nhygiene, personal protective equipment, and food and water safety measures are integral to preventing infectious diarrheal \nillnesses. (Am Fam Physician. 2022;\u200b106(1):72-80.

For many of the more severe \nasthma patients, significant advances in medical \ncare have reduced exacerbations and improved \nquality of life. Appropriate diagnosis, recognition \nof different phenotypes, and an understanding of the various treatment options are paramount \nin asthma management.

Wheezing and \nnocturnal dyspnoea have a strong correlation \nwith diagnosis of asthma (relative risk:  26% and \n29%, respectively), and wheezing is the single \nmost sensitive and prevalent symptom for the \ndiagnosis of asthma.5,6 Respiratory symptoms \nthat vary over time and in intensity, that are \nworse at night or in the morning, and that have \nspecific triggers are associated with a higher \nlikelihood of an asthma diagnosis.7 On the other \nhand, the presence of chronic sputum production, \nchest pain, and isolated cough with no other \nrespiratory symptoms decrease the probability \nof \nasthma.7 \nDetailed \nhistory-taking \nis \nan \nimportant step in the diagnosis of asthma and \nevidence of variable airflow limitation confirmed \nby a physician is required to confirm the \npresence of the disease.7", "page": 1, "source": "s3://meddoc-raw/knowledge/Asthma-Diagnosis-and-Treatment.pdf#page=1", "type": "knowledge"}, {"file": "knowledge/Asthma-Diagnosis-and-Treatment.json", "chunk_id": 3, "text": "Differential Diagnosis Asthma can mimic other diseases and, therefore, \nit is important to consider various differential \ndiagnoses in patients presenting with asthma-\nlike \nsymptoms. \nDifferential \ndiagnoses \nof \nasthma include diseases of the upper and \nlower respiratory tracks, pathologies of the \ncardiovascular \nand \ngastrointestinal \nsystems, \nand psychiatric conditions (Box 1).8 For example, \ncongestive heart failure can cause wheezing \nand \nairflow \nobstruction \nfrom \npulmonary \noedema and pulmonary vascular congestion, \nmimicking asthma.9 This condition has been \ntermed \u2018cardiac asthma\u2019 and treatment of \nthe underlying heart failure often leads to the \nimprovement of the symptoms.10 Vocal \ncord \ndysfunction \n(VCD) \nis \nanother \ncommon \ndifferential \ndiagnosis \nof \nasthma. \nThese patients often present with recurrent \nasthma exacerbations that are refractory to \ncorticosteroids or bronchodilator treatment. \nVCD is caused by episodic extrinsic airway \nobstruction from paradoxical vocal cord motion \nand is closely associated with gastro-oesophageal", "page": 2, "source": "s3://meddoc-raw/knowledge/Asthma-Diagnosis-and-Treatment.pdf#page=2", "type": "knowledge"}, {"file": "knowledge/Asthma-Diagnosis-and-Treatment.json", "chunk_id": 4, "text": "reflux, laryngopharyngeal reflux, anxiety, and \ndepression.11 Recognition of VCD is important \nin limiting unnecessary corticosteroid exposure \nand healthcare utilisation.11 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \nis a progressive, obstructive lung disease that \npresents similarly to asthma.
